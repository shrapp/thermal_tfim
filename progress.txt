I have searched for a difference between a maximal mixed state and a pure X state for the kink calculation and there is no difference.
That means that i should come back to the same values after the maximal noise is applied.
My code seams to take me from periodic to open boundary conditions and its obviously wrong.
why if for every k the probability is 0.5 , the kink prob is not the same?

I have found the error in the code. I didnt write the correct noise matrix (dissipator).
I have to try run it again and see if the results are correct.
