I have searched for a difference between a maximal mixed state and a pure X state for the kink calculation and there is no difference.
That means that i should come back to the same values after the maximal noise is applied.
My code seams to take me from periodic to open boundary conditions and its obviously wrong.
why if for every k the probability is 0.5 , the kink prob is not the same?

I have found the error in the code. I didnt write the correct noise matrix (dissipator).
I have to try run it again and see if the results are correct.

The wide MMS is actually a steady state of both the hamiltonian comutator and the dissipator.
We should understand why its make sense and does it even possible to get back into the maximal mixed state with any noise.
- write our findings so far
- solve the analitycal derivation with parameters (g and noise seperately)
- run qiskit for small system
